#MancuCode
Welcome to MankuCode, a platform where you can improve your programming skills by solving coding puzzles. The puzzles are designed to challenge you at various levels, from beginner to advanced. You can choose the programming language you prefer, including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and C#.

Each puzzle presents a code snippet followed by a multiple-choice question. You'll be able to see whether your answer is correct or incorrect, with an explanation of the code to help you understand the solution better. The puzzles are structured to gradually increase in difficulty, offering a fun and interactive way to learn programming.

Currently in Progress
This project is still being developed, and new features, puzzles, and improvements will be added soon. Stay tuned for updates!
